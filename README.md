# cifar10-neural-network-classifier
Implementing a neural network classifier using tensorflow for cifar-10 dataset, without any libraries but numpy.  
The project contains three different optimizers including GradientDescent, Adam and RMSProp.
We also Implement a cross-antropy loss layer as the loss function.
